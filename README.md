# Detour - Khoi. Ft Two
I heard it from a song
Where you’re going,
a day never dies
A heart never breaks
And a loss is just another lesson
Were you my lesson ??
Were you my lesson ??
Were you my lesson ??
Were you my lesson ??
Were you my lesson ??
Were you my lesson ??
Were you my lesson ??
Were you my lesson ??

I was a lost soul,
coming down from all the **** this world has thrown my way,
world as thrown my way.
Maybe we were meant for something more but I don’t think I can take this no longer,
I don’t think I can take this no….
I was a lost soul,
coming down from all the **** this world has thrown my way,
world as thrown my way.
Maybe we were meant for something more but I don’t think I can take this, no more.
I don’t think I can take this no more
I thought I found my way I thought I found my way with you, but you’re just another detour you’re just another detour.
